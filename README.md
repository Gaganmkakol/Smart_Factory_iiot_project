 IoT-based Smart Factory System
 
The IoT-based Smart Factory System with Sensor Integration and Cloud 
Connectivity project uses the power of Internet of Things technologies. We create a smooth and seamless system by 
combining various sensors and connecting them to cloud connectivity. This system revolutionizes factory 
operations by enabling automation, optimization, and real-time monitoring. These 
sensors encompass temperature and humidity sensors, flame sensors, and infrared sensors 
(IR) sensors for product counting, and load cells for precise weight measurement. 
The data collected from these sensors serves as a valuable resource, offering deep 
insights into the factory environment and facilitating informed decision-making 
for enhanced operational efficiency. By implementing our IoT-based Smart 
In the Factory System, manufacturers gain unprecedented levels of efficiency and 
productivity. Integrating sensors, cloud connectivity, and data analytics 
provides invaluable insight. 
The IoT-based Smart Factory System provides several 
advantages to manufacturers. It automates critical processes such as activating 
ventilation systems based on temperature and humidity readings or triggering 
water pumps in response to flame detection. The system also offers real-time 
Display of weight measurements, allowing precise monitoring of product 
quantities.
